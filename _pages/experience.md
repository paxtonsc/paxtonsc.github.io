* BS, **Engineering-Physics**  \|  *Stanford University*  \|  2018 - 2022



## Professional Experience
* **Software Developer** \| Stanford, CA | *Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability* \| Jan 2025 - Present
    * Work closely with Prof. Eric Dunham to add feature to [python library](https://github.com/fredriclam/quail_volcano) to more accurately model Vulcanian eruptions. 


* **Software Engineer** \| Seattle, WA \| *SpaceX* \| Aug 2023 - Dec 2024
    * Worked on multiple projects related to increasing the software update speed on satellites and user terminals, developed persistent storage safety check, and led telemetry reduction effort. 


* **Software Intern** \| Seattle, WA \| *SpaceX* \|
June 2022 - Sept 2022 
    * Wrote a new ground service in C++ and Python as part of the Fleet Software Team to query Swarm satellite ephemerides and improve ground-to-satellite communication reliability.


* **Modeling and Simulation Intern** \| Colorado Springs, CO \| *Boecore* \| June 2021 - Sept 2021
    * Worked on a C++ application to facilitate communication between infrared and radar sensors and the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BCM) system.


* **Physics/Math Tutor** \| Stanford, CA \| *Schwab Learning Center* \| Sept 2019 - Aug 2021 
    * Tutored undergrads in mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, algorithms, linear algebra, probability, calculus, and differential equations.


* **Software Intern** \| Durango, CO \| *Stoneage Waterblast Tools* \| Dec 2020 - March 2021 
    * Full stack development with React/Node.js/MongoDB. Built out an IoT product for StoneAge's Sentinel robot using the AWS IoT Core to stream telemetry from the robot to our backend.

* **LSST Physics Research Fellow** \| Stanford, CA \| *Stanford Physics Department* \| June 2020 - Sept 2020
    * Used a recurrent neural network in PyTorch to emulate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) deblending pipeline in order to better understand systemic bias in weak lensing probes as a result of unrecognized galaxy-galaxy blends.
