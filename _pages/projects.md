## [Control of Inverted Pendulum](https://github.com/paxtonsc/inverted-pendulum-project/blob/main/inverted_pendulm.ipynb)

After departing SpaceX in December of 2024, I wanted to work more on GNC software (mechanics, state estimation, control, etc) rather than the more pure software problems I was working on at SpaceX. I had not touched a partial derivative since graduating Stanford in the spring of 2023, so I decided to brush up on some kinematics and controls by working my way through the inverted pendulum control problem.

## [Starling Mission Distributed System Control Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZp61ES1jcYmPNGCX5coH_GLsXfdG6Gs/view)

As part of *AA279D: Control of Distributed Space Systems*, my partner and I wrote a report on NASA's Starling mission analyzing the Keplerian orbital mechanics, relative motion, linear formation flying dynamics, control perturbation-invariant formations, and nonlinear formation control.

## [Megatronics (ME 210) Group Project](https://polygnomial.github.io/me210-project/)

As a final project for *ME 210: Introduction to Megatronics*, I worked with a group of 4 to design and build a simple robot that could move balls around a course. We designed and built three progressively complex iterations of the robot in 2.5 weeks. I was lead of the mechanic design and also assisted writing the state machine and software for the robot. View our project website [here](https://polygnomial.github.io/me210-project/). 

## [American Sign Language 3D CNN](https://paxtonsc.github.io/images/CS213n_project_final.pdf)

My partner and I retrained the final layers of a 3D convolutional neural network model to identify American sign language words as a final project for *CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision*. I then spun up a Flask backend and React frontend and built a simple website that allowed users to record a video of themselves signing a word and the model would output its top five guesses.

## [Rubin Observatory Deblending Emulator](/files/LSSTpresentation.pdf)

The summer of my freshmen year, I worked on summer research project with Pat Burchat to use PyTorch to develop different neural network architecture to emulate the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) deblending pipeline in order to better understand systemic bias in weak lensing probes as a result of unrecognized galaxy-galaxy blends.


## [2D plotter robot from scratch](/images/projects/cs107e.mp4)

As a final project for *CS107E: Computer Systems from the Ground Up*, my partner and I built a 2D plotting robot using a bare metal raspberry pie, a custom laser cut chassis, and stepper motors purchased off Amazon. I personally did all of the mechanical design and wrote the G-code parser to translate g-code (exported from [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) into steps for our two stepper motors.
