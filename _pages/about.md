## Hi, I am Paxton Scott

I am a Software Engineer with a BS in Engineering-Physics '22 and MS in Computer Science '23, and I am interested in applying software to the intersection of physics and computer science. During my time at Stanford, I was a member of Stanford Student Space Initiative, an RA for [Outdoor House](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/02/23/new-to-the-neighborhood-outdoor-house-returns-with-a-focus-on-accessible-outdoor-education/), and a writer for the [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/author/paxtonscott/).

After graduating spring of 2023, I moved to Seattle to work on the TTC Software Team at [SpaceX Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/us) where I wrote vehicle and ground side software to improve satellite software update speed and cadence. 

In December of 2024, I returned to the bay area and have since been working with [Eric Dunham's lab](https://pangea.stanford.edu/~edunham/) in the [Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability](https://sustainability.stanford.edu/) to improve numerical modeling of Vulcanian volcanic eruptions. 

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy changing my altitude whenever possible: cycling, trail running, climbing, skiing, walking, strolling, larking, [etc](/adventures/).
