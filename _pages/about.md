## Hi, I am Paxton Scott

I am a Software Engineer interested in applying software to the intersection of physics and computer science. Currently, I am working on the TTC Software Team at [SpaceX Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/us) where I work on writing vehicle and ground side software to improve satellite software update speed and cadence. 

I completed a B.S. in Engineering Physics and an M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford University. During my time at Stanford, I was a member of Stanford Student Space Initiative, an RA for [Outdoor House](https://stanforddaily.com/2022/02/23/new-to-the-neighborhood-outdoor-house-returns-with-a-focus-on-accessible-outdoor-education/), and a writer for the [The Stanford Daily](https://stanforddaily.com/author/paxtonscott/).

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy changing my altitude whenever possible: cycling, trail running, climbing, strolling, larking, [etc](/_adventures/).
