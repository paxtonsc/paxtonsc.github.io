We started skinning across Bow Lake and up towards Bow Hut at about 5 PM after spending most of the day in Calgary waiting for Sam's skies to arrive from Vancouver. Our start was further delayed by other afternoon shenanigans including getting our rental car briefly stuck in a snowbank. Fortunately, Bow Hut is not very far from Bow Lake and we made it to the hut as the light was fading.

The next morning we went our for a pre-breakfast ski to the summit of Mt. Gordon. The snow was still light and the views were expansive. After returning to the hut, eating breakfast, and reviewing our crevasse rescue procedures we loaded our backpacks and began the traverse towards the Richard Guy Hut.

We skin across the Wapta Icefield from the Bow Hut towards the Richard Guy Hut. Fortunately, there was an existing skin track the led us cleanly through the crevasse field.

The next morning, we eat a slow breakfast of Celia constructed gluten free pancakes before putting on skies and climbing to summit of Des Poilus.

The view from Des Poilus was much better than the south facing skiing off the summit. After a brief inspection and run down the smaller Yoho peak, we return to the Guy Hut for lunch, snow cream (condensed milk and snow), and many rounds of hearts.

And we had a nice sunset that evening.

As we head towards the Stanley Mitchel Hut we pause in the grey morning light to inspect the toe of the the Des Poilus Glacier.

The Stanley Mitchell is the oldest hut on the traverse and we have the entire hut to ourselves. Unlike the Bow and Guy hut, the Mitchell hut is below treeline without more modern features like propane heating and attached bathrooms present in the other huts.

We got about 8 centimeters of fresh snow the first night we stayed at Stanley Mitchell which made for excellent turns the subsequent day. We summited Mount Kerr and had a sublime ski down the Northwest face.

Wyatt is generous enough to snap a group photo of us off the summit of Mount Kerr.

For our final day, we ski up towards the Presidents for a final lap and then skin and slide the long flat road down the Yoho valley back to the car.
