My partner and I retrained the final layers of a 3D convolutional neural network model to identify American sign language words as a final project for *CS231N: Deep Learning for Computer Vision*. I then spun up a Flask backend and React frontend and built a simple website that allowed users to record a video of themselves signing a word and the model would output its top five guesses.
