As a final project for *CS107E: Computer Systems from the Ground Up*, my partner and I built a 2D plotting robot using a bare metal raspberry pie, a custom laser cut chassis, and stepper motors purchased off Amazon. I personally did all of the mechanical design and wrote the G-code parser to translate g-code (exported from [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)) into steps for our two stepper motors.
