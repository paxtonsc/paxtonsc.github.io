As a final project for *ME 210: Introduction to Megatronics*, I worked with a group of 4 to design and build a simple robot that could move balls around a course. We designed and built three progressively complex iterations of the robot in 2.5 weeks. I was lead of the mechanic design and also assisted writing the state machine and software for the robot.
